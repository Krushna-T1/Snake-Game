## Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items, with the objective of avoiding collisions with itself and the walls of the game area.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (W, A, S, D) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will move continuously in the direction it is facing.
- Try to eat the food items (represented by red squares) to grow longer.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.

## Files Included
- **snake.html**: HTML file containing the structure of the game and linking necessary resources.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the game elements.
- **snake.js**: JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.
